The dataset has been downloaded from figshare website link- https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427/5

It is organized in matlab data format (.mat file). Each file stores a struct containing the following fields for an image:

- cjdata.label: 1 for meningioma, 2 for glioma, 3 for pituitary tumor
- cjdata.PID: patient ID
- cjdata.image: image data
- cjdata.tumorBorder: a vector storing the coordinates of discrete points on tumor border.
        - For example, [x1, y1, x2, y2,...] in which x1, y1 are planar coordinates on tumor border.
        - It was generated by manually delineating the tumor border. So we can use it to generate
        - binary image of tumor mask.
- cjdata.tumorMask: a binary image with 1s indicating tumor region
